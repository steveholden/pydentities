### Some Python identities to help understand the interpreter.

This Jupyter Notebook began as a lightning talk to the
PyData London group on 5 July, 2016.

It explains by example various equivalences in the language
that will hopefully give the reader some insight into the
operation of the interpreter.
The HTML version retains outputs to make it easier to read.
The notebook itself has no outputs, so it can be presented as
an interactive slide show with executable code cells.

I'll be very happy to accept pull requests that expand or
enlarge on the current material, and issues where the content
is incorrect, misleading or suboptimal.

## Presenting as Slides

The RISE notebook extension lets you present the notebook as
slides, and the cells are correctly organised for a meaningful
presentation. You can add the necessary extension to your
Python environment with

    pip install rise

Restarting the Jupyter notebook server should give you access
to the slide presentation features.
